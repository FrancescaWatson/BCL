# BCL examples 

This folder contains examples from various sources such as literature, standards, and datasheets, presented in both JSON and JSON-LD formats. These examples illustrate the application of the BCL structure and demonstrate how data can be standardized and linked for better interoperability and analysis.

1. JSON Files
Description: These files represent the raw data following the Battery Cycling Language (BCL) structure.
Purpose: To provide a standardized and human writable representation of battery cycling data that can be easily parsed and used for various applications such as simulations and analyses.

2. JSON-LD Files
Description: These files are the linked data versions of the JSON files, following the JSON-LD format.
Purpose: To enhance the interoperability and discoverability of the data by embedding context and linking information to standard vocabularies such as EMMO (Elementary Multiperspective Material Ontology).

Usage
Viewing the Examples
- Open the JSON files with any text editor or JSON viewer to see the raw BCL structured data.
- Open the JSON-LD files with any JSON-LD viewer or text editor to see the linked data format.
